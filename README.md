# Pomodoro Remix

This is a small Pomodoro timer written using [Remix](https://remix.run/).

## Development

Prerequisites:

- A local Postgres installation
- [asdf](https://asdf-vm.com/) to install dependencies (or you can install a compatible version of Node.js by hand)

Clone a copy of this repo and `cd` into it, then run `asdf install` to pull down a compatible version of Node, then `npm install` to install packages.

Then create a file at the repository root called `.env` that looks like this:

```
# URL to a database on your local Postgres instance. (No need for the DB to exist yet as long as your local user has permission to create it.)
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://<user>@localhost:5432/pomodoro-remix?schema=public
```

Then run `npx prisma migrate reset` to set up the database and run migrations.

At that point you should be able to run the dev server via:

```
npm run dev
```

It'll spin up a Vite dev server with hot module reloading. Open up the URL it writes to stdout and you're off to the races!

## Deployment

[This section is from the README generated by Remix and needs to be expanded with e.g. Prisma migration magic]

First, build your app for production:

```sh
npm run build
```

Then run the app in production mode:

```sh
npm start
```

Now you'll need to pick a host to deploy it to.

### DIY

If you're familiar with deploying Node applications, the built-in Remix app server is production-ready.

Make sure to deploy the output of `npm run build`

- `build/server`
- `build/client`
